This is supposed to be a firefox add-on that lets you create Nepomuk bookmarks
so it shows up, for eg, in a Plasma Active activity.

Unfortunately the completed version got lost, so this is a broken stub that
I'm putting here in case I might need such an add-on again someday, then
I'll have something to start with.
