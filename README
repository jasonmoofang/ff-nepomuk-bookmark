This is a firefox add-on that lets you create Nepomuk bookmarks
so it shows up, for eg, in a Plasma Active activity.

You'll need to make the create-bookmark script executable, and
manually change the string "/home/lim/bin/create-bookmark" in
content/main.js to the path to your create-bookmark script before
zipping and installing.

Hacked up solutions tend to be this way :)
